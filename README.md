# Relational Database, For a Mock Client

<br>

Hello!

In this university project, I was given a mock client, who was running a fitness business, and wanted to store that businesses data, in an electronic database. After considering the nature of the data, and how it would be interacted with on a daily basis, I determined a relational database would be most appropriate, and then began building said database:

### Conceptual Model

So, first I created a conceptual model of the fitness businesses relational database, visible here: <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>


### 2 Extra Forms, Normalisation Process

Then, the client gave me some additional information. They use 2 different paper forms as part of their business, a class staffing report form, and a class attendance report form. They wanted the data from those forms, to be put into the database as well.

Thus, I took the forms, and applied the normalization process to them, to help cut down on redundancy and insert/update/delete anomalies that would very likely arise otherwise. The process to both forms is visible here: <br>

<br>
<br>


### Logical Model

Once the forms were in 3NF, they were combined with the conceptual model, and a logical model was built, visible here: <br>

The SQL Code automatically generated by Oracle SQL Developer, to build the logical model in the DBMS, is here: <br>

# Additional SQL Code

With the fitness businesses database now fully built in Oracle SQL Developer, I began practicing SQL, on two other mock relational databases in Oracle. 

The first was medical facilities database, and I wrote queries for it, visible here: <br>

The second was a library networks database, and I wrote inserts, deletes, and general alterations, visible here: <br>
